Social phobia, also known as social anxiety disorder, is a mental health condition where individuals have an intense, persistent fear of being watched and judged by others. This fear can affect work, school, and other daily activities. People with social phobia may worry about acting or appearing visibly anxious, or being seen as stupid, awkward, or boring.

Common symptoms include:
- Rapid heartbeat
- Nausea or upset stomach
- Sweating or trembling
- Avoiding eye contact
- Fear of speaking in public
- Overthinking social interactions

Causes may include:
- Genetics
- Brain structure
- Environment (e.g., negative experiences)

Helpful coping strategies:
- Practice breathing exercises
- Gradually face social situations
- Prepare for social interactions
- Talk to a therapist
- Join support groups

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective treatments for social anxiety. It focuses on identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and gradually exposing individuals to feared social situations.

If you feel overwhelmed, remember that help is available. Speaking to a mental health professional can make a big difference.

Useful tips for daily life:
- Focus on the present moment
- Set small goals for social activities
- Reward yourself for small successes
- Be kind and patient with yourself
